Introduction
------------

Retro is built using a metacompiler. This consists of two parts,
an assembler, and a target compiler.

The assembler provides symbolic names for the opcodes, support
for setting an entry point, and support for labels. Code using
it will compile to a special memory area set aside, but with a
base address of 0. You *can not* invoke assembled code until
it is relocated by the metacompiler.

The target compiler provides colon definitions, conditionals,
and loops, all compiling into the target memory region. It also
contains support for setting up the initial classes and the
initial dictionary.

The metacompiler also contains code to relocate the new image
over the old one.


Using the metacompiler
----------------------
When the metacompiler is loaded, it initializes a target memory
area of 4096 cells in size. Two variables ('target' and
'origin') are created and set to point to the start of this
region.

Data is written to the target memory area using 'm,'. This word
takes a value off the stack, writes it to the address 'target'
points to, then advances 'target' by 1.

The symbolic opcodes use m, to write their values to the target
memory region. Refer to Table 1 for a list of opcodes provided
by the assembler.

Some opcodes require an additional value in the memory location
that follows them. These opcodes are:

  lit,
  call,
  jump,
  >jump,
  <jump,
  =jump,
  !jump,

The first, 'lit,', takes a value from the following location
and pushes it to the stack. The others take an address to call
or branch to.

The assembler portion also provides support for labels via the
'label:' word. Labels can be referenced as variables or address
values to call or branch to.

Since execution of an image always starts with address 0, the
assembler compiles a 'jump,' instruction there upon creating
the target region. You can mark the actual entry point using
'main:'.

An example of the assembler:

  label: foo 10 m,     ( variable 'foo', with initial value of 10 )

  label: bar           ( we'll reference 'bar' as a word name )
         lit, foo m,   ( compile a literal pointer to 'foo' )
         @,            ( fetch instruction to get the contents of 'foo' )
         ;,            ( and exit instruction to end our word )

  main:                ( mark the main entry point )
         call, bar m,  ( compile a call to 'bar' )
         halt,         ( and end the program )

The assembler also has two helper words to make things a bit
more readable. These are '#' and '$,'. The word '#' replaces
the 'lit, value m,' sequence with 'value #', while '$,' copies
a string into the target memory area. Using '#', we can rewrite
the example above to be slightly more readable:

  label: bar
         foo # @, ;,

Note that multiple instructions can be placed on each line. Our
sample now appears a bit more like traditional Forth code.

The metacompiler also provides a colon compiler and a few Forth
words that can be used to make things much cleaner:

  10 variable: foo
  t: bar foo # @, ;
  main: bar halt,

These words are covered in Table 2.

To be covered:
: entry  ( a"- ) t-here link @ m, link ! m, m, 32 accept tib $, ;
: word:  ( a"- ) 'WORD @ entry ;
: macro: ( a"- ) 'MACRO @ entry ;
: data:  ( a"- ) 'DATA @ entry ;
: patch-dictionary ( - ) link @ chain @ ! ;
: mark-dictionary  ( - ) target @ chain ! ;

: set-class ( aa- ) ! ;

t-here
returns a pointer to the current memory location in the target
memory area, adjusted to be relative to a base of 0.
