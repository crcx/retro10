RETRO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a small dialect of Forth. It's minimalistic in nature
and is designed to be fairly easy to learn and customize for
specific needs.

There are two parts to Retro, an executable which provides the
virtual machine, and an image file which contains the actual
Retro language.

This is the source code for the image file. You will need the
VM to fully build this. Modify the VM line in the Makefile to
point to your VM.

The latest docmentation can be found in the 'doc' directory.
